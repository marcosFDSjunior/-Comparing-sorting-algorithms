# Comparing sorting algorithms

The sorting algorithms selected for this small project were:

• Bubble Sort

• Insertion Sort

• Quick Sort

I will show some screenshots that will facilitate the understanding of each step:

## Step 1: Enter how many integers will be created for the vector of each case.

In this example, the user typed 10. That means that 10 numbers will be created for the vector of each case.

## Step 2: Display the vector of each case.

The application will show the vector of each case:

• Best Case vector: a random vector containing positive integers in ascending order.

• Medium Case vector: a random vector containing positive integers in scrambled order.

• Worst Case vector: a random vector containing positive integers in decreasing order.
