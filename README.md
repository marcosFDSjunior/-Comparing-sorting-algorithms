# Comparing sorting algorithms

Hi. I will show some screenshots that will facilitate the understanding of each step:

## Step 1: Enter how many integers will be created for the vector of each case.

In this example, the user typed 10. That means that 10 numbers will be created for the vector of each case.

## Step 2: Display the vector of each case.

The application will create the vector of each case:

• Best Case vector: a random vector containing positive integers in ascending order.

• Medium Case vector: a random vector containing positive integers in scrambled order.

• Worst Case vector: a random vector containing positive integers in decreasing order.

The range of possible numbers for each vector depends on the number of elements the user has entered. For example, if the user typed 10, the range of possible numbers will be from 1 to 10.

## Step 3: Choose a numeric option from the "Options Menu".

Each numeric option represents a type of sorting algorithm. The sorting algorithms selected for this small project were:

• Bubble Sort

• Insertion Sort

• Quick Sort

What if the user enters a nonexistent option as shown in the screenshot below?

In the example above, the user entered option 1. This means that he chose Bubble Sort to put the vector of each case in ascending order.
